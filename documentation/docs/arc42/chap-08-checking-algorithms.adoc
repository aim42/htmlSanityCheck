=== Flexible Checking Algorithms
kbd:[HtmlSC] uses the {template-method-pattern} to enable flexible checking algorithms:

[quote, http://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns/template_method]
The Template Method defines a skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, and defers some steps to subclasses.

We achieve that by defining the skeleton of the checking algorithm in one operation, deferring the specific checking algorithm steps to subclasses.

The invariant steps are implemented in the abstract base class, while the variant checking algorithms have to be provided by the subclasses.

[source, groovy]
    /**
     * template method for performing a single type of checks
     * on the given @see HtmlPage.
     *
     * Prerequisite: pageToCheck has been successfully parsed,
     * prior to constructing this Checker instance.
    **/
    public CheckingResultsCollector performCheck() {
        // assert prerequisite
        assert pageToCheck != null
        initResults()
        return check() // execute the actual checking algorithm
    }

|===


==== MissingImageFilesChecker

[small]#Adresses requirement <<Types of Sanity Checks, R1>>.#

Checks if image files referenced in +<img src="someFile.jpg"+ really
exists on the local filesystem.

The (little) problem with checking images is their path: Consider the following
HTML fragment (from the file +testme.html+:


[source, html]
<img src="./images/one-image.jpg">


This image file ("one-image.jpg") has to be located relative to the directory
containing the corresponding HTML file.

Therefore the expected absolute path of the "one-image.jpg" has to be determined
from the absolute path of the html file under test.

We check for existing files using the usual Java api, but have to do some
_directory arithmetic_ to get the +absolutePathToImageFile+:

[source, java]
  File f = new File( absolutePathToImageFile );
  if(f.exists() && !f.isDirectory())


==== MissingImgAltAttributeChecker
[small]#Addresses requirement <<Types of Sanity Checks, R-6>>.#

Simple syntactic check: iterates over all <img> tags to check
if the image has an alt-tag.


==== BrokenCrossReferencesChecker
[small]#Addresses requirement <<Types of Sanity Checks, R-2>>.#

Cross references are document-internal links where the +href="link-target" from the html anchor
tag has no prefix like +http+, +https+, +ftp+, +telnet+, +mailto+, +file+ and such.

Only links with prefix +#+ shall be taken into account, e.g. +<a href="#internalLink">+.


==== DuplicateIdChecker

[small]#Addresses requirement <<Types of Sanity Checks, R-4>>.#

Sections, especially headings, can be made link-targets by adding the +id="#xyz"+ element,
yielding for example html headings like the following example.

Problems occur if the same link target is defined several times (also shown below).

[source,html]
  <h2 id="seealso">First Heading</h2>
  <h2 id="seealso">Second Heading</h2>
  <a href="#seealso">Duplicate definition - where shall I go now?</a>


==== MissingLocalResourcesChecker

[small]#Addresses requirement <<Types of Sanity Checks, R-3>>.#

Current limitation: Does *NOT* check references-with-anchors of the following form:

[source,html]
  <a href="api/core/Artifact.html#mvcGroupInit">GroupInit</a>

containing both a local (file) reference plus an internal anchor +#mvcGroupInit+




==== BrokenExternalLinksChecker

[small]#Addresses requirement <<Types of Sanity Checks, R-9>>.#

Problem here are networking issues, latency and HTTP return codes. This checker is planned,
but currently not implemented.


==== IllegalLinkChecker

[small]#Addresses requirement <<Types of Sanity Checks, R-5>>.#

This checker is planned, but currently not implemented.
