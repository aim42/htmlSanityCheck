* Implement kbd:[HtmlSC] in {groovy-url}[Groovy] and Java with minimal
external dependencies. Wrap this implementation into a {gradle-url}

in the <<gradle-plugin-concept, Gradle plugin concept>>.

* Apply the _template-method-pattern_ (see e.g. {template-method-url}) to enable
** multiple checking algorithms. See the <<checking-concept, concept for checking algorithms>>.
** both HTML (file) and text (console) output. See the <<reporting-concept, reporting concept>>.
