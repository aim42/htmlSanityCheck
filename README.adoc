ifndef::xrefToGradlePlugin[:xrefToGradlePlugin: htmlSanityCheck-gradle-plugin/README.adoc]

[.lead]
====
This project provides some basic sanity checking on html files.

It can be helpful in case of html generated from, e.g., {asciidoc-url}[Asciidoctor],
Markdown or other formats -- as converters usually don't check for missing images
or broken links.

[[sec:usage,usage]]
== Usage

HSC can be currently used

* As a xref:{xrefToGradlePlugin}#sec:usage[Gradle plugin], or
* Programmatically from Java or other JVM languages (TBD).

[NOTE]
.Future releases
====
In the future, we plan to provide

* A standalone Java (CLI) executable, and
* An https://maven.apache.org[Apache Maven] Plugin.
====

[[sec:installation]]
== Installation

Depending on your <<sec:usage>> you have to

* Install the xref:{xrefToGradlePlugin}#sec:installation[Gradle Plugin], or
* Install the core library for programmatic use (TBD).

[[sec:examples]]
== Examples

Depending on your <<sec:usage>> find respective

* xref:{xrefToGradlePlugin}#sec:examples[Gradle Plugin] examples, and
* Core library examples (TBD).

== Typical Output

[cols="1,1",width="50%"]
|===
| The overall goal is to create neat and clear reports,
showing eventual errors within HTML files - as shown in the adjoining figure.

== Types of Sanity Checks

=== Broken Cross References (aka Broken Internal Links)

Finds all '<a href="XYZ">' where XYZ is not defined.

.src/broken.html
[source,html]
----
<a href="#missing">internal anchor</a>
...
<h2 id="missinG">Bookmark-Header</h2>
----

In this example, the bookmark is _misspelled_.

Use checkerClass _BrokenCrossReferencesChecker_.

=== Missing Images Files

Images, referenced in `<img src="XYZ"...` tags, refer to external files.
The plugin checks the existence of these files.

Use checkerClass _MissingImageFilesChecker_.

=== Multiple Definitions of Bookmarks or ID's

If any is defined more than once, any anchor linking to it will be confused.

Use checkerClass _DuplicateIdChecker_.

=== Missing Local Resources

All files, (e.g., downloads) referenced from html.

Use checkerClass _MissingLocalResourcesChecker_.

=== Missing Alt-tags in Images

Image-tags should contain an alt-attribute that the browser displays when the original image file cannot be found or cannot be rendered.
Having alt-attributes is a good and defensive style.

Use checkerClass _MissingAltInImageTagsChecker_.

=== Broken HTTP Links

The current version (derived from branch 1.0.0-RC-2) contains a simple implementation that identifies errors (status >400) and warnings (status `1xx` or `3xx`).

StatusCodes are configurable ranges (as some people might want some content behind paywalls NOT to result in errors...)

Localhost or numerical IP addresses are currently NOT marked as suspicious.

Please comment in case you have additional requirements.

Use checkerClass _BrokenHttpLinksChecker_.

=== Other types of external links

*planned*: ftp, ntp or other protocols are currently not checked, but should...

== Technical Documentation

In addition to checking HTML, this project serves as an example for https://arc42.de[arc42].

Please see our https://aim42.github.io/htmlSanityCheck/arc42/About-This-Docu.html[software architecture documentation].

== Fundamentals

This tiny piece rests on incredible groundwork:

* https://jsoup.org[Jsoup HTML parser] and analysis toolkit - robust and easy-to-use.

* IntelliJ IDEA - my (Gernot) best (programming) friend.

* Of course, Groovy, Gradle, JUnit and Spock framework.

== Ideas and Origin

* The plugin heavily relies on code provided by {gradle-url}[Gradle].

* Inspiration on code organization, implementation and testing of the plugin came from the {asciidoctor-gradle-plugin-url}[Asciidoctor-Gradle-Plugin] by [@AAlmiray].

* Code for string similarity calculation by
https://github.com/rrice/java-string-similarity[Ralph Rice].

* Implementation, maintenance and documentation by
* Current implementation, main
** Initially: {gernotstarke}[Gernot Starke],
** Currently: {gerdaschemann}[Gerd Aschemann] and several other contributors.

== Development

In case you want to check out, fork and/or contribute, take a look into our https://aim42.github.io/htmlSanityCheck/[Development Information]

== Similar Projects

* The https://github.com/rackerlabs/gradle-linkchecker-plugin[gradle-linkchecker-plugin] is an (open source) Gradle plugin which validates that all links in a local HTML file tree go out to other existing local files or remote web locations.
It creates a simple text file report and might be a complement to this `HtmlSanityChecker`.
* https://bmuschko.com/blog/golang-with-gradle/[Benjamin Muschko] has created a (Go-based) command-line tool to check links, called https://github.com/bmuschko/link-verifier[link verifier].
* https://github.com/gjtorikian/html-proofer[html-proofer] is written in Ruby and provides different usage scenarios (programmatically, CLI, and Docker).
* https://github.com/wjdp/htmltest[htmltest] is also written in Go(Lang) and claims to be rapid compared to `html-proofer` (stay tuned; we have plans for HSC to run with Graal in a quick way).
