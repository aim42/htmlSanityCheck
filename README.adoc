This project provides some basic sanity checking on html files.

It can be helpful in case of html generated from e.g. {asciidoc-url}[Asciidoctor],
Markdown or other formats - as converters usually don't check for missing images
or broken links.

It can be used as Gradle plugin. Standalone Java and graphical UI
are planned for future releases.

== Installation

Use the following snippet inside a Gradle build file:

.build.gradle
[source,groovy]
[subs="attributes"]
----
buildscript {
    repositories {
        jcenter()
    }

    dependencies {
        classpath 'org.aim42:{project}:{version}'
    }
}

apply plugin: 'org.aim42.{project}'
----

== Usage

The plugin adds a new task named `htmlSanityCheck`.

This task exposes a few properties as part of its configuration:

[horizontal]
sourceDir:: (mandatory) directory where the html files are located. Type: File. Default: `build/docs`.
sourceDocuments:: (optional) an override to process several source files, which may be a subset of all
                      files available in [x-]`${sourceDir}`. Type: Set.
                      Defaults to all files in [x-]`${sourceDir}`.

checkingResultsDir:: (optional) directory where the checking results written to.
                      Defaults to `${sourceDir}/report/htmlchecks/`

checkExternalLinks:: (optional, planned) if set to "true", external references are checked too.
                      Defaults to `false` (currently not implemented)


.build.gradle (real-world example)
[source,groovy]
----
apply plugin: 'org.aim42.HtmlSanityCheck-gradle-plugin'

htmlSanityCheck {
    sourceDir = new File( "$buildDir/docs" )

    // files to check - in Set-notation
    sourceDocuments = [ "one-file.html", "another-file.html", "index.html"]

    // where to put results of sanityChecks...
    checkingResultsDir = new File( "$buildDir/report/htmlchecks" )
    checkExternalLinks = false
}
----

== Typical Output

| The overall goal is to create neat and clear reports,
showing evantual errors within HTML files - as shown in the adjoining figure.

== Types of Sanity Checks

=== Broken Cross References (aka Broken Internal Links)

Finds all '<a href="XYZ">' where XYZ is not defined.

.src/broken.html
[source,html]
----
<a href="#missing>internal anchor</a>
...
<h2 id="missinG">Bookmark-Header</h2>
----

In this example, the bookmark is _misspelled_.


=== Missing Images Files
Images, referenced in '<img src="XYZ"...' tags, refer to external files. The existence of
these files is checked by the plugin.

=== Multiple Definitions of Bookmarks or ID's
If any is defined more than once, any anchor linking to it will be confused :-)

=== Missing Local Resources
All files (e.g. downloads) referenced from html.

=== Missing Alt-tags in Images
Image-tags should contain an alt-attribute that the browser displays when the original image
file cannot be found or cannot be rendered. Having alt-attributes is good and defensive style.


=== Broken External Links
*planned*

Although external links might suffer from network issues or site maintenance,
checks are still possible...



== Technical Documentation
In addition to checking HTML, this project serves as an example for http://arc42.de[arc42].

Please see our link:documentation/docs/hsc_arc42.adoc[software architecture documentation].


== Fundamentals
This tiny piece rests on incredible groundwork:

* http://jsoup.org[Jsoup HTML parser] and analysis toolkit - robust and easy-to-use.

* IntelliJ IDEA - my (Gernot) best (programming) friend.

* Of course, Groovy, Gradle, JUnit and Spockframework.


== Ideas and Origin

* The plugin heavily relies on code provided by the {gradle-url}[Gradle project].

* Inspiration on code organization, implementation and testing of the plugin
came from the {asciidoctor-gradle-plugin-url}[Asciidoctor-Gradle-Plugin] by [@AAlmiray].

* Code for string similarity calculation by
  https://github.com/rrice/java-string-similarity[Ralph Rice].

* Initial implementation, maintenance and documentation by {gernotstarke}[Gernot Starke].

== Development
Several sources provided help during development:

* http://www.gradle.org/docs/current/userguide/custom_plugins.html[Gradle guide on writing custom plugins]
* The code4reference tutorial an Gradle custom plugins,
http://code4reference.com/2012/08/gradle-custom-plugin-part-1/[part 1] and
http://code4reference.com/2012/08/gradle-custom-plugin-part-2/[part 2].
* Of course, the http://jsoup.org/apidocs/[JSoup API documentation]


== Contributing
Please report {plugin-issues}[issues or suggestions].

Want to improve the plugin: Fork our {plugin-url}[repository] and
send a pull request.

== Licence
Currently code is published under the Apache-2.0 licence,
documentation under Creative-Commons-Sharealike-4.0.

Some day I'll unify that :-)
