This project provides some basic sanity checking on html files.

It can be helpful in case of html generated from e.g. {asciidoc-url}[Asciidoctor],
Markdown or other formats - as converters usually don't check for missing images
or broken links.

It can be used as Gradle plugin. Standalone Java and graphical UI
are planned for future releases.

== Installation

Use the following snippet inside a Gradle build file:

.build.gradle
[source,groovy]
[subs="attributes"]
----
plugins {
  id 'org.aim42.{project}' version '{version}'
}
----

OR

.build.gradle
[source,groovy]
[subs="attributes"]
----
buildscript {
    repositories {
        maven {
              url "https://plugins.gradle.org/m2/"
            }
    }

    dependencies {
        classpath ('gradle.plugin.org.aim42:{project}:{version}')
    }
}

apply plugin: 'org.aim42.{project}'
----

== Usage

The plugin adds a new task named `htmlSanityCheck`.

This task exposes a few properties as part of its configuration:

[horizontal]
sourceDir:: (mandatory) directory where the html files are located. Type: File. Default: `build/docs`.
sourceDocuments:: (optional) an override to process several source files, which may be a subset of all
                      files available in [x-]`${sourceDir}`. Type: Set.
                      Defaults to all files in [x-]`${sourceDir}`.

checkingResultsDir:: (optional) directory where the checking results written to.
                      Defaults to `${buildDir}/report/htmlchecks/`

junitResultsDir:: (optional) directory where the results written to in JUnit XML format. JUnit XML can be
                  read by many tools including CI environments.
				  Defaults to `${buildDir}/test-results/htmlchecks/`

failOnErrors:: (optional) if set to "true", the build will fail if any error was found in the checked pages.
                      Defaults to `false`



== Examples

.build.gradle (small example)
[source,groovy]
----
apply plugin: 'org.aim42.htmlSanityCheck'

htmlSanityCheck {
    sourceDir = new File( "$buildDir/docs" )

    // files to check - in Set-notation
    sourceDocuments = [ "one-file.html", "another-file.html", "index.html"]

    // where to put results of sanityChecks...
    checkingResultsDir = new File( "$buildDir/report/htmlchecks" )

    // fail build on errors?
    failOnErrors = true

}
----


.build.gradle (extensive example)
[source, groovy]
----

buildscript {
    repositories {
        maven {
            url "https://plugins.gradle.org/m2/"
        }
        jcenter()
    }
}


plugins {
    id 'org.aim42.htmlsanitycheck' version '1.0.0-RC-2'
    id 'org.asciidoctor.convert' version '1.5.8'
}


// ==== path definitions =====
// ===========================

// location of AsciiDoc files
def asciidocSrcPath = "$projectDir/src/asciidoc"

// location of images used in AsciiDoc documentation
def srcImagesPath = "$asciidocSrcPath/images"

// results of asciidoc compilation (HTML)
// (input for htmlSanityCheck)
// this is the default path for asciidoc-gradle-convert
def htmlOutputPath = "$buildDir/asciidoc/html5"

// images used by generated html
def targetImagesPath =   htmlOutputPath + "/images"

// where HTMLSanityCheck checking results ares stored
def checkingResultsPath = "$buildDir/report/htmlchecks"


apply plugin: 'org.asciidoctor.convert'

asciidoctor {
    sourceDir = new File( asciidocSrcPath )

    options backends: ['html5'],
            doctype: 'book',
            icons: 'font',
            sectlink: true,
            sectanchors: true

    resources {
        from( srcImagesPath )
        into targetImagesPath
    }


}

apply plugin: 'org.aim42.htmlSanityCheck'


htmlSanityCheck {

    // ensure asciidoctor->html runs first
    // and images are copied to build directory

    dependsOn asciidoctor

    sourceDir = new File( htmlOutputPath )

    // files to check, in Set-notation
    sourceDocuments = [ "many-errors.html", "no-errors.html"]

    // where to put results of sanityChecks...
    checkingResultsDir = new File( checkingResultsPath )

    // fail build on errors?
    failOnErrors = false

   // http connection timeout in milliseconds
    httpConnectionTimeout = 1000

    // which statuscodes shall be interpreted as warning, error or success
    // defaults to standard
    httpWarningCodes = [401]
    // httpErrorCodes
    // httpSuccessCodes

}

== Typical Output

|===
| The overall goal is to create neat and clear reports,
showing eventual errors within HTML files - as shown in the adjoining figure.

== Types of Sanity Checks

=== Broken Cross References (aka Broken Internal Links)

Finds all '<a href="XYZ">' where XYZ is not defined.

.src/broken.html
[source,html]
----
<a href="#missing">internal anchor</a>
...
<h2 id="missinG">Bookmark-Header</h2>
----

In this example, the bookmark is _misspelled_.


=== Missing Images Files
Images, referenced in '<img src="XYZ"...' tags, refer to external files. The existence of
these files is checked by the plugin.

=== Multiple Definitions of Bookmarks or ID's
If any is defined more than once, any anchor linking to it will be confused :-)

=== Missing Local Resources
All files (e.g. downloads) referenced from html.

=== Missing Alt-tags in Images
Image-tags should contain an alt-attribute that the browser displays when the original image
file cannot be found or cannot be rendered. Having alt-attributes is good and defensive style.


=== Broken HTTP Links
The current version (derived from branch 1.0.0-RC-2) contains a simple
implementation that identifies errors
(status >400) and warnings (status 1xx or 3xx).

StatusCodes are configurable ranges (as some people might
want some content behind paywalls NOT to result in errors...)

Localhost or numerical IP addresses are currently NOT marked as suspicious.

Please comment in case you have additional requirements.

=== Other types of external links
*planned*: ftp, ntp or other protocols are currently not checked,
but should...



== Technical Documentation
In addition to checking HTML, this project serves as an example for http://arc42.de[arc42].

Please see our https://rawgit.com/aim42/htmlSanityCheck/gh-pages/hsc_arc42.html[software architecture documentation].


== Fundamentals
This tiny piece rests on incredible groundwork:

* http://jsoup.org[Jsoup HTML parser] and analysis toolkit - robust and easy-to-use.

* IntelliJ IDEA - my (Gernot) best (programming) friend.

* Of course, Groovy, Gradle, JUnit and Spockframework.


== Ideas and Origin

* The plugin heavily relies on code provided by the {gradle-url}[Gradle project].

* Inspiration on code organization, implementation and testing of the plugin
came from the {asciidoctor-gradle-plugin-url}[Asciidoctor-Gradle-Plugin] by [@AAlmiray].

* Code for string similarity calculation by
  https://github.com/rrice/java-string-similarity[Ralph Rice].

* Initial implementation, maintenance and documentation by {gernotstarke}[Gernot Starke].

== Development

In case you want to checkout, fork and/or contribute:
The documentation is maintained using the awesome
https://github.com/docToolchain/docToolchain[docToolchain] project.

After checkout you should execute:

`git submodule update -i`

to ensure that the docToolchain submodule is downloaded.

=== Helpful Sources for Development

Several sources provided help during development:

* http://www.gradle.org/docs/current/userguide/custom_plugins.html[Gradle guide on writing custom plugins]
* The code4reference tutorial an Gradle custom plugins,
http://code4reference.com/2012/08/gradle-custom-plugin-part-1/[part 1] and
http://code4reference.com/2012/08/gradle-custom-plugin-part-2/[part 2].
* Of course, the http://jsoup.org/apidocs/[JSoup API documentation]

== Similar Projects

* The https://github.com/rackerlabs/gradle-linkchecker-plugin[gradle-linkchecker-plugin] is an (open source) gradle plugin
which validates that all links in a local HTML file tree go out to other existing local files or remote web locations.
It creates a simple text file report and might be a complement to this `HtmlSanityChecker`.

* https://bmuschko.com/blog/golang-with-gradle/[Benjamin Muschko] has created a (go-based) command-line tool
to check links, called https://github.com/bmuschko/link-verifier[link verifier]

== Licence
Currently code is published under the Apache-2.0 licence,
documentation under Creative-Commons-Sharealike-4.0.

Some day I'll unify that :-)
