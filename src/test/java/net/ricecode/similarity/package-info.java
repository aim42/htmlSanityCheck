/**
 Calculates a similarity score between two strings.
 A score of 0.0 means that the two strings are absolutely dissimilar,
 and 1.0 means that absolutely similar (or equal).
 Anything in between indicates how similar each the two strings are.

 This package has been created by Ralph Rice (@rrice),
 @see https://github.com/rrice/java-string-similarity
