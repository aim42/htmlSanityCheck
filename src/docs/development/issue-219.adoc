=== Handling 403 and 405 Status Codes


https://github.com/aim42/htmlSanityCheck/issues/219[Issue 219]
explains that the naive link checks based upon
a http HEAD request sometimes fail, e.g. for links to amazon.com:

For example: (`curl -I performs a HEAD request)

....
<snip>

curl -I https://www.amazon.de/dp/3446443487
HTTP/2 405
server: Server
content-type: text/html;charset=UTF-8

</snip>

....

This is clearly a _false negative_,
as the URL itself is correct and the
page exists.



==== Proposed Approach

[plantuml,"GET-after-HEAD-failapproach",png]
....
@startuml
skinparam maxmessagesize 80
participant BrokenLinksChecker as BLC
participant RelaxedServer as RS
participant PickyServer as PS

-> BLC: check()
activate BLC

BLC -> BLC: setTimeout

BLC -> RS: HEAD goodURL
RS --> BLC: statuscode 200: OK

BLC -> PS: HEAD otherURL
PS --> BLC: statuscode 405
BLC -> PS: GET otherURL
PS --> BLC: realStatus

....

The general behavior we implement shall be the following
`
[source, Groovy]
----
if (responseCode in successCodes) then return
else {

    // try GET
    connection.setRequestMethod("GET")
    int finalResponseCode = connection.getResponseCode()

    switch (realResponseCode) {
        case warningCodes: println "real warning $responseCode"; break
        case errorCodes: println "real error $responseCode"; break

        default: println "Error: Unknown or unclassified response code"
    }
}
