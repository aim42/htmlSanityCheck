=== Prerequisites

==== General Prerequisites

Make yourself familiar with

* The{gradle-url}[Gradle] build system,
* the {maven-url}[Maven] build system,
* https://jsoup.org/apidocs/[JSoup API documentation].

==== Prerequisites for Gradle Plugin Development

You should definitely read the original https://www.gradle.org/docs/current/userguide/custom_plugins.html[Gradle Plugin Development Guide] and the https://maven.apache.org/plugin-developers/index.html[Maven User Guide] on custom plugin development.


=== Adding New Checks
To add new checks, you have to subclass from 'org.aim42.htmlsanitycheck.check.Checker'
and implement the 'performCheck' method - which requires an 'HtmlPage' instance as parameter.

Remember to:

* Write a (JUnit) test or (Spock) spec for your checker -
the code in https://github.com/aim42/htmlSanityCheck/tree/develop/htmlSanityCheck-core/src/test/groovy/org/aim42/htmlsanitycheck/check[htmlSanityCheck-core/src/test/groovy/org/aim42/htmlsanitycheck/check]
gives many examples
* Add your checker class to the https://github.com/aim42/htmlSanityCheck/blob/develop/htmlSanityCheck-core/src/main/java/org/aim42/htmlsanitycheck/check/AllCheckers.java[`public static AllCheckers`] list
of available checkers. This set is used to configure the 'AllChecksRunner' class.

=== Directory Structure and Required Files

==== Core Module

TBD

==== Gradle Plugin

----
<1> the actual plugin code, a xyzPlugin and xyzTask groovy files
<2> Gradle expects plugin properties in META-INF
<3> Property file containing the name of the actual implementation class:

 implementation-class=org.aim42.htmlsanitycheck.gradle.HtmlSanityCheckPlugin

==== Notes for IntelliJ Users
If you work with IntelliJ, you should configure your run- and test configurations
so that the working-directory is set to your current module - most easily done
by making $MODULE_DIR$ your default.

==== Maven Plugin

To be done //todo
