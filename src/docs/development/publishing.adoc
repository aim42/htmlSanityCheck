==== Handling (Secret) Credentials
We use Etienne Studers awesome
https://github.com/etiennestuder/gradle-credentials-plugin[Gradle-Credentials plugin]
to allow automatic deployment to public portals (like Bintray, JCenter and/or Gradle-Plugin-Portal)
and keep the appropriate passwords/API-keys secret.

Brief instructions below - for details see the
https://github.com/etiennestuder/gradle-credentials-plugin[credentials plugin]

. integrate the plugin in the buildfile
. get the required credentials from the Bintray website (or wherever you want to publish artifacts)
. add the required credentials:
+
[source]
----
> gradle addCredentials --key bintrayUserName --value <your-Bintray-username>
:addCredentials

BUILD SUCCESSFUL

> gradle addCredentials --key bintrayApiKey --value <some-long-key>
----
. Within the buildfile you can now access these credentials as follows:
+
[source]
----
// include these lines in your build.gradle:
println "Username        : " + credentials.bintrayUserName
println "Bintray API Key : " + credentials.bintrayApiKey
----
