=== Flexible Reporting
kbd:[HtmlSC] allows for different output formats:

* formats (HTML and text) and
* destinations (file and console)


The reporting subsystem uses the template method pattern to allow different output formats
(e.g. Console and HTML). The overall structure of reports is always the same:

Graphical clients can use the API of the reporting subsystem to display
reports in arbitrary formats.

The (generic and abstract) reporting is implemented in the abstract Reporter class
as follows:

[source, groovy]
/**
 * main entry point for reporting - to be called when a report is requested
 * Uses template-method to delegate concrete implementations to subclasses
*/
    public void reportFindings() {
        initReport()            // <1>
        reportOverallSummary()  // <2>
        reportAllPages()        // <3>
        closeReport()           // <4>
    }
//
    private void reportAllPages() {
        pageResults.each { pageResult ->
            reportPageSummary( pageResult ) // <5>
            pageResult.singleCheckResults.each { resultForOneCheck ->
               reportSingleCheckSummary( resultForOneCheck )  // <6>
               reportSingleCheckDetails( resultForOneCheck )  // <7>  
               reportPageFooter()                             // <8>
        }
    }

<1> initialize the report, e.g. create and open the file, copy css-, javascript and image files.

<2> create the overall summary, with the overall success percentage and a list of all checked pages with their success rate.

<3> iterate over all pages 

<4> write report footer - in HTML report also create back-to-top-link

<5> for a single page, report the nr of checks and problems plus the success rate 

<6> for every singleCheck on that page, report a summary and 

<7> all detailed findings for a singleCheck.

<8> for every checked page, create a footer, page break or similar to graphically distinguish
pages between each other.




==== Styling the Reporting Output

* The `HtmlReporter` explicitly generates css classes together with the html elements,
based upon css styling re-used from the Gradle JUnit plugin.
* Stylesheets, a minimized version of jQuery javascript library plus some icons
are copied at report-generation time from the jar-file to the report output directory.

* Styling the back-to-top arrow/button is done as a combination of JavaScript plus some css styling, as described in http://www.webtipblog.com/adding-scroll-top-button-website/.


==== Copy Required Resources to Output Directory

When creating the HTML report, we need to copy the required resource files (css, JavaScript)
to the output directory.

The appropriate copy method was re-used from the https://github.com/gradle/gradle/blob/master/subprojects/performance/src/testFixtures/groovy/org/gradle/performance/results/ReportGenerator.java#L50-50[Gradle sources].
