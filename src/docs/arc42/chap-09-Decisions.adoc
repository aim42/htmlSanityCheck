== Design Decisions

=== Checking of external links postponed
In the current {revision} we won't check external links.
These checks have been postponed to later versions.



=== HTML Parsing with jsoup
To check HTML we parse it into an internal (DOM-like) representation.
For this task we use {jsoup-url}, an open-source parser without
external dependencies.

To quote from the jsoup website:

[quote]
jsoup is a Java library for working with real-world HTML.
It provides a very convenient API for extracting and manipulating data,
using the best of DOM, CSS, and jQuery-like methods.


Goals of this decision::
Check HTML programmatically by using an existing API that provides access and finder
methods to the DOM-tree of the file(s) to be checked.

Decision Criteria::
* few dependencies, so the kbd:[HtmlSC] binary stays as small as possible.
* accessor and finder methods to find images, links and link-targets within the DOM tree.

Alternatives::

* HTTPUnit: a testing framework for web applications and -sites. Its main focus is web testing and it suffers from a large number of dependencies.
* jsoup: a plain HTML parser without any dependencies (!) and a rich API to access all HTML elements in DOM-like syntax.

<<html-encapsulation, HTML encapsulation concept>>.


=== String Similarity Checking with http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaro%E2%80%93Winkler_distance[Jaro-Winkler-Distance]

The small https://github.com/rrice/java-string-similarity[java-string-similarity] library (by Ralph Allen Rice) contains implementations of several similarity-calculation algorithms. As it is *not available* as public binary,
we use the sources instead, primarily:

  net.ricecode.similarity.JaroWinklerStrategyTest
  net.ricecode.similarity.JaroWinklerStrategy

[NOTE]
The actual implementation of the similarity comparison has been postponed
to a later release of kbd:[HtmlSC]
