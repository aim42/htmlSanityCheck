== Introduction and Goals

image::{improveDocImage}[link={repositoryDocsDir}arc42/chap-01-Requirements.adoc, float=right]

kbd:[HtmlSC] shall support authors creating digital formats
with hyperlinks and integration of images and similar resources.

[[requirements]]
=== Requirements Overview


[cols="1,1",width="50%"]
|===
| The overall goal of kbd:[HtmlSC] is to create neat and clear reports,
showing errors within HTML files - as shown in the adjoining figure.

|===



==== Basic Usage

. A user configures the location (directory and filename) of one or more HTML file(s),
. and the corresponding images directory.
. kbd:[HtmlSC] performs various checks on the HTML and
. reports its results either on the console or as HTML report.

kbd:[HtmlSC] can run from the command line or as {gradle-url}-plugin.


[Terminology]
==== Terminology: What Can Go Wrong in HTML Files?

Apart from purely syntactical errors, many things can go wrong in html, especially with respect to hyperlinks, anchors and id's - as those are often manually maintained.

Primary sources of problems are bad links (in technical terms: URIs). For further information, see the <<InformationOnUris, background information on URIs>>.


.Broken Cross References:: Cross-references (internal links) can be broken, e.g. due to missing or misspelled link-targets.
See <<BrokenCrossReferencesChecker>>

.Missing image files: Referenced image files can be missing or misspelled.
See <<MissingImageFilesChecker>>.

.Missing local resources: Referenced local resources (other than images) can be missing or misspelled.
See <<MissingLocalResourcesChecker>>

.Duplicate link targets: link-targets can occur several times with the same name - so the browser cannot know which is the desired target.
See <<DuplicateIdChecker>>.

.Illegal links:: The links (aka anchors or URIs) can contain illegal characters or violate HTML link syntax. See <<IllegalLinkChecker>>

.Broken external links: External http links can be broken due to myriads of reasons: misspelled, link-target currently offline, illegal link syntax.
See <<BrokenHttpLinksChecker>>.

.Missing Alt Attribute in Image Tags: Images missing an alt-attribute.
See <<MissingImgAltAttributeChecker>>.

Checking and reporting these errors and flaws is the central _business requirement_ of kbd:[HtmlSC].



Important terms (*domain terms*) of html sanity checking is documented in a (small)
<<HTML Checking Domain Model, domain model>>.

[[requiredChecks]]
==== Types of Sanity Checks


[options="header", cols="1,3,8"]
.Required Checks
|===
| ID  | Check | Description
| R-1 | missing image files   | Check all image tags if the referenced

                                  (href="#XYZ") if the link targets "XYZ" are defined.
                                  See <<BrokenCrossReferencesChecker>>
| R-3 | missing local files   | either other html-files, pdf's or similar.
                                  See <<MissingLocalResourcesChecker>>
| R-4  | duplicate link targets | Check all bookmark definitions
                                  (... id="XYZ") whether the id's ("XYZ") are unique.
                                  See <<DuplicateIdChecker>>
| R-5  | malformed links        | Check all links for syntactical correctness
| R-6  | missing alt-attribute  | in image-tags.  See <<MissingImgAltAttributeChecker>>
| R-7  | unused-images          | Check for files in image-directories that are not referenced by any
                                  of the HTML files in this _run_
| R-8  | illegal link targets   | Check for malformed or illegal anchors (link targets).

[[quality-goals]]
=== Quality Goals

[options="header", cols="1,2,6"]
.Quality-Goals
|===
| Priority | Quality-Goal | Scenario
| 1        | Correctness  | Every broken internal link (cross reference) is found.
| 1        | Correctness  | Every missing local image is found.
| 2        | Flexibility  | Multiple checking algorithms, report formats and clients. At least
Gradle, command-line and a graphical client have to be supported.
| 2        | Safety       | Content of the files to be checked is _never_ altered.
| 2        | Correctness  | Correctness of every checker is automatically tested for positive AND negative
                            cases
| 2        | Correctness  | Every reporting format is tested: Reports must exactly reflect checking results.
| 3        | Performance  | Check of 100kB html file performed under 10 secs
(excluding gradle startup)

[[InformationOnUris]]
=== Background Information on URIs

The generic structure of a Uniform Resource Identifier consists of
the following parts:
+++[type][://][subdomain][domain][port][path][file][query][hash]+++

An example, visualized:

image::uri-generic-example.png[]

The `java.net.URL` class contains a generic parser for URLs and URIs.
See the following snippet, taken from the unit test class `URLUtilTest.groovy`:


[source, groovy]
.Generic URI Structure
----
include::{coretestpath}/htmlsanitycheck/html/URLUtilTest.groovy[tags=GenericURIExample]

----


URIs are used to *reference* other resources.
For  kbd:[HtmlSC] it is useful to distinguish between internal (== local)and external references:

* Internal references, a.k.a. Cross-References
* External references


==== Intra-Document URIs

a file... ref can be an internal link, or a URI without protocol...


==== References on URIs and HTML Syntax

* http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt[IETF RFC-2396 on URI Syntax]: The
fundamental reference!
