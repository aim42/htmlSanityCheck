| artifact repository (https://bintray.com/bintray/jcenter[Bintray]) | global public _cloud_ repository for binary artifacts, similar to http://search.maven.org/[mavenCentral].  kbd:[HtmlSC] binaries are uploaded to this server.

|===

The three nodes (_computers_) shown in <<img-deployment>> are connected via Internet.

Sanity checker will:

. be bundled as a single jar,
. be uploaded to the Bintray repository, 
. referencable within a gradle buildfile,
. provide a +main+ method with parameters and options, so all checks can be
called from the command line.
