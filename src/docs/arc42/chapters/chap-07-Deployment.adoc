|===

The three nodes (_computers_) shown in <<img-deployment>> are connected via Internet.

Sanity checker will:

. be bundled as a single jar,
. be uploaded to the Bintray repository, 
. referencable within a gradle buildfile,
. provide a +main+ method with parameters and options, so all checks can be
called from the command line.
