.Deployment
|===
| Node / Artifact | Description
| hsc plugin binary | compiled version of HSC, including required dependencies.
| hsc-development | where development of HSC takes place
| artifact repository (https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/[Maven Central]) | public Java artifact repository, cf. https://search.maven.org/[Maven Central Search].
| hsc user computer | where arbitrary documentation takes place with html as output formats.
| build.gradle    |  Gradle build script configuring (among other things) the HSC plugin to check _some documentation_.
|===

The three nodes (_computers_) shown in <<img-deployment>> are connected via Internet.

Sanity checker will:

. be bundled as a single jar,
. be uploaded to the Bintray repository, 
. referencable within a gradle buildfile,
. provide a +main+ method with parameters and options, so all checks can be
called from the command line.
