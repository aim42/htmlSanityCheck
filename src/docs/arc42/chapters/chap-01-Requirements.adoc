== Introduction and Goals

:filename: arc42/chapters/chap-01-Requirements.adoc

HSC shall support authors creating digital formats
with hyperlinks and integration of images and similar resources.

[[sec:requirements]]
=== Requirements Overview

The overall goal of HSC is to create neat and clear reports,
showing errors within HTML files - as shown in the adjoining figure.

==== Basic Usage

Precondition::
A user configures the location (directory and filename) of one or more HTML file(s), including the corresponding image's directory.
Action::
HSC performs various checks on the files, and
Postcondition::
Reports its results either on the console or as HTML report.

HSC can run

* From the command line (CLI), or
* As {gradle-url}[Gradle]-plugin, or
* As {maven-url}[Maven]-plugin.



.Terminology: What Can Go Wrong in HTML Files?
****
Apart from purely syntactical errors, many things can go wrong in html, especially with respect to hyperlinks, anchors and id's -- as those are often manually maintained.

Primary sources of problems are bad links (in technical terms: URIs).
For further information, see the <<InformationOnUris, background information on URIs>>.

Broken Cross References:: Cross-references (internal links) can be broken, e.g. due to missing or misspelled link-targets.
See {xrefAlgorithmBrokenCrossReferencesChecker}

Missing image files:: Referenced image files can be missing or misspelled.
See {xrefAlgorithmMissingImageFilesChecker}.

Missing local resources:: Referenced local resources (other than images) can be missing or misspelled.
See {xrefAlgorithmMissingLocalResourcesChecker}

Duplicate link targets:: link-targets can occur several times with the same name - so the browser cannot know which is the desired target.
See {xrefAlgorithmDuplicateIdChecker}.

Illegal links:: The links (aka anchors or URIs) can contain illegal characters or violate HTML link syntax. See {xrefAlgorithmIllegalLinkChecker}.

Broken external links:: External http links can be broken due to myriads of reasons: misspelled, link-target currently offline, illegal link syntax.
See {xrefAlgorithmBrokenHttpLinksChecker}.

Missing Alt Attribute in Image Tags:: Images missing an alt-attribute.
See {xrefAlgorithmMissingImgAltAttributeChecker}.

Checking and reporting these errors and flaws is the central _business requirement_ of HSC.

Important terms (*domain terms*) of html sanity checking is documented in a (small)
{xrefConceptDomainModel}.

[[InformationOnUris]]
=== Background Information on URIs

The generic structure of a Uniform Resource Identifier consists of
the following parts:
+++[type][://][subdomain][domain][port][path][file][query][hash]+++

An example, visualized:

image::uri-generic-example.png[]

The `java.net.URL` class contains a generic parser for URLs and URIs.
See the following snippet, taken from the unit test class `WebTest.groovy`:

URIs are used to *reference* other resources.
For  HSC it is useful to distinguish between internal (== local)and external references:

* Internal references, a.k.a. Cross-References
* External references


==== Intra-Document URIs

a file... ref can be an internal link, or a URI without protocol...
