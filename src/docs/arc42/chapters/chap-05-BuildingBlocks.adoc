=== Whitebox HtmlSanityChecker


[plantuml,whitbox-hsc-level-1,svg]
....
include::../../plantuml/whitebox-hsc-level-1.puml[]
....



Rationale::

We used _functional decomposition_ to separate responsibilities:

* {xrefConceptCheckerCore} shall encapsulate checking logic and Html parsing/processing.
* all kinds of outputs (console, html-file, graphical) shall be handled in a separate component
  (`Reporter`)
* Implementation of Gradle specific stuff shall be encapsulated.

| HSC Gradle Plugin | integrates the Gradle build tool with HSC,
enabling arbitrary gradle builds to use HSC functionality.

.HtmlSanityChecker internal interfaces
|===
| Interface | Description

| usage via shell
| an (arc42) user uses a command line shell to call HSC

| Buildsystem
| Currently restricted to Gradle: The build system uses HSC as configured in the buildscript.

| Local filesystem
| HSC needs access to several local files, especially the html page to be checked and to the corresponding image directories.

| External websites
| to check external links, HSC needs to access external sites via http HEAD or GET requests.

[[sec:checker_blackbox]]
==== _HSC Core_ (Blackbox)

Intent/Responsibility:: HSC Core contains the core functions
to perform the various sanity checks. It parses the html file
into a DOM-like in-memory representation, which is then
used to perform the actual checks.


Interfaces::

[cols="2,4", options="header"]
.HSC Core Interfaces
|===
| Interface (From-To) | Description

| Command Line Interface -> Checker
| Uses the #AllChecksRunner class.

| Gradle Plugin -> Checker
| Exposes HSC via a standard Gradle plugin,
as described in the Gradle user guide.

==== _HSC Core_ (Whitebox)


image::ea/htmlSanityCheck/hsc-core.png["Whitebox", title="HSC Core (Whitebox)"]

Rationale::
This structures follows a strictly functional decomposition:

* parsing and handling html input
* checking
* collecting checking results

Contained Blackboxes::

[cols="1,4" options=""]
.HSC Core building blocks
|===
| Checker
| Abstract class, used in form of the template-pattern. Shall be subclassed
for all checking algorithms.

| AllChecksRunner
| Facade to the different Checker instances. Provides a (parameter-driven)
command-line interface.

| <<ResultsCollector>>
| Collects all checking results. Its interface `Results` is contained in the
<<ResultsCollector, whitebox description>>

| Reporter
| Reports checking results to either console or an html file.

| HtmlParser
| Encapsulates html parsing, provides methods to search
within the (parsed) html.

| Suggester
| In case of checking issues, suggests alternatives by comparing the faulty element
to the one present in the html file. Currently not implemented
|===


==== Checker and xyzChecker Subclasses

The abstract Checker provides a uniform interface (`public void check()`) to different checking algorithms.
It is based upon the extensible {xrefConceptCheckingAlgorithms}.

[[ResultsCollector]]
==== ResultsCollector (Whitebox)

image::ea/htmlSanityCheck/ResultsCollector.png["Whitebox", title="Results Collector (Whitebox)"]

Rationale::
This structures follows the hierarchy of checks - namely managing results for:

. a number of pages/documents, containing:
. a single page, each containing many
. single checks within a page


Contained Blackboxes::

[cols="1,4" options=""]
.ResultsCollector building blocks
|===
| Per-Run Results
| results for potentially many Html pages/documents.

| Single-Page-Results
| results for a single page

| Single-Check-Results
| results for a single type of check (e.g. missing-images check)

| Finding
| a single finding, (e.g., "image 'logo.png' missing"). Can hold suggestions
and (planned for future releases) the responsible html element.

===== Interface `Results`

The `Result` interface is used by all clients
(especially `Reporter` subclasses, graphical and command-line
clients) to access checking results. It consists of three distinct APIs for
overall `RunResults`, single-page results (`PageResults`) and single-check results
(`CheckResults`). See the interface definitions below - taken from the Groovy-
 source code:
