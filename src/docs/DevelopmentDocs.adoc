== Prerequisites

=== Prerequisites for Gradle Plugin Development
You should definitely read the original [Gradle User Guide] on custom plugin development.


=== Adding New Checks
To add new checks you have to subclass from 'org.aim42.htmlsanitycheck.check.Checker'
and implement the 'performCheck' method - which requires an 'HtmlPage' instance as parameter.

Don't forget to:
* write a test or spec for your checker - the code in 'test/groovy/org.aim42.htmlsanitycheck.check'
gives many examples
* add your checker class to the 'public static AllCheckers' list (Set, to be precise)
of available checkers. This set is used to configure the 'AllChecksRunner' class.


=== Directory Structure and Required Files

<1> the actual plugin code, a xyzPlugin and xyzTask groovy files
<2> Gradle expects plugin properties in META-INF
<3> Property file containing the name of the actual implementation class:

 implementation-class=org.aim42.htmlsanitycheck.HtmlSanityCheckPlugin

=== Notes for IntelliJ Users
If you work with IntelliJ, you should configure your run- and test configurations
so that the working-directory is set to your current module - most easily done
by making $MODULE_DIR$ your default.

== Building the Plugin

=== Uploading / Publishing to Maven Central and Bintray

t.b.c.

=== Uploading to Gradle Plugin Repository
Currently we use the Gradle Plugin Repository to host the plugin - which is very simple
to configure for users.
