*The Problem*: Languages like AsciiDoc or Markdown allow for easy writing and
hyperlinking. When they are transformed to HTML the _sanity_ of links
and images is not checked - that's where HSC comes into play...

HSC can perform various content and semantic checks on HTML files,
e.g. check for missing images, broken internal links, duplicate targets etc.

It is open source software and provides documentation for the following
types of stakeholders:
